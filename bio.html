I pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems and soon after earning my degree, I volunteered at the Girls Coding Week by Vodacom Foundation.Currently, I am professioanally working Office Administrator and Trainer at BasaliTech.BasaliTech PTY is a Lesotho registred non profit organisation that exixts to provide affordable opportunities for women and children interested in learning Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) through in-person classes, workshops, seminars, and community support. This is to protect their futures by introducing them to a growing field industry and to address a social challenge of gender gap in STEM careers.I did minor Business Administration courses and major Computer Science courses,but most of the things I have learned are self-taught through online tutorials and constant self-study.

                            I then went to St. Stephens High School in Mohale's hoek from 2009 and sat for my junior certificate in 2011 and obtained a first class pass. In my junior years I was an active member of the Science and Mathematics club. My role was participating in problem solving activities during regional and national fairs. I continued into high school where my role in the club took a leadership turn as Banda Chair Lady, where I mentored students in matters of the club and life in general.

                            In July 2014 I began a Bachelors Degree in Infromation Systems at the National university of Lesotho. During the four year program, I was involved in various group projects that sharpened my intepersonal skills. Working on these projects also enhanced my ability to conduct research and develop solution from various material. During my last year I also volunteered to be a lab instructor where I mentored junior students on the use of microsoft office tools. In the 2018/19 academic year I was involved in an E-Health Facilitation project as a final year project. The life cycle of the project involved visiting health centers to find out their daily proccess flow and using that information to design and develop a sysytem that would be of use to such centers.
